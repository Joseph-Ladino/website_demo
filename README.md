# website_demo
I am designing a website using PHP (for practice purposes) 
and I would like to share my code/progress with everybody on Github!
I try to update often so you come back and see what's new.


Feel free to use this as a template, though I wouldn't recommend it 
because the source files are published to the internet.
Also feel free to send me suggestions for improving this little demo I'm making :)
